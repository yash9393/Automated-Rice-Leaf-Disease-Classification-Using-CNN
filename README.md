# Automated-Rice-Leaf-Disease-Classification-Using-CNN
This project uses CNNs for early detection and classification of rice leaf diseases. It analyzes leaf images to identify diseases and recommends eco-friendly pesticides for sustainable crop management. The solution aids in proactive disease management, reducing pesticide use, and promoting environmental safety.

## Key features include:

Data Preprocessing: Images are processed using techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation to ensure optimal performance in various conditions.
Model Architecture: A deep CNN model is trained on a large dataset of rice leaf images, achieving high accuracy in disease classification.
Pesticide Recommendation: Based on the identified disease, the model suggests appropriate eco-friendly pesticides to minimize environmental impact while ensuring effective treatment.
Impact: This solution enhances crop management, reduces pesticide use, and contributes to sustainable agriculture by providing farmers with accurate, actionable insights.
